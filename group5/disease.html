    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Inflictions passed down genetically are much more complicated <br>
    than what most people would usually know. We listed a few commonly <br>
    known ones bellow to showcase some of their important details that <br>
      most people have skipped out on</p>

      <h2>Diabetes</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Short Description</h2>
      <p>Elevated blood sugar levels in our body causing abnormal harmful effects. Such as increased thirst, fatigue
        and frequent urination</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Description and Symptoms</h2>
      <p>Diabetes or more specifically the inherited version called Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)
        happens due to a genetic mutation that is connected to how your body makes and uses insulin.</p>
      <p>If left unchecked you would eventually encounter the more worse symptoms such as blurred vision, slow healing
        cuts and sores and even frequent yeast infections all the way to hypoglycemia and even amputation.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>Besides taking oral diabetes medications the other aspect that needs to be addressed is the monitoring of
        your glucose(blood sugar) which pertains to the dosages that one should intake.</p>
      <p>One of the modern tools that greatly helps with monitoring glucose levels is a CGM Continuous glucose
        monitoring tool which is a sensor just under your skin allowing a person to have 24 hours of results
        readily available.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Statistics</h2>
      <p>The number of diabetics in the Philippines according to trading economics is roughly 7% of the population.
        Now take this number with a grain of salt as not all 7% is actually hereditary and that according to the
        American Diabetes Association having one parent with diabetes puts a person at 40% of risk while having 2
        parents involves 70%.</p>

    <div class="diseases">
      <h2>Asthma</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Short Description</h2>
      <p>A chronic lung disease affecting people of all ages. It is caused by inflammation and muscle tightening around the
        airway, which makes it harder to breathe.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Description and Symptoms</h2>
      <p>Asthma is a recurring inflammatory condition affecting the airway, characterized by variable expiratory airflow and
        reversible bronchoconstriction, usually caused by trigger factors, that is different from every patient. In an
        asthma attack, the airway lining swells and the surrounding muscles contract. This condition limits the flow of
        air through the lungs and leads to abnormal breathing.</p>
      <p>The most common symptoms of asthma are cough, difficulty of breathing, wheezing, and chest tightness.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>Treatment for asthma commonly involves therapy of various kinds, such as immunotherapy to signal the body to
        combat the asthma cells, and surgery to remove affected areas like tumors.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Statistics</h2>
      <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) states that around 12% of the Philippines' population, approximately 90 million
        people, is affected by asthma. Data from the Global Asthma Report indicates that roughly 11 million Filipinos,
        equating to 1 out of every 10 individuals, are grappling with asthma.</p>
      <p>Asthma inheritance is influenced by a mix of genetic and environmental factors. While a family history of asthma
        and certain genetic variations increase susceptibility, the development of asthma relies on interactions between
        these genetic factors and environmental triggers like allergens and irritants.</p>

    <div class="diseases">
      <h2>Cancer</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Short Description</h2>
      <p>Deterioration of the body due to cancer cells spreading in your body.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Description and Symptoms</h2>
      <p>Cancer is a genetic disorder when your cells abnormally stay too long beyond their expiration date. Cancer cells
        are basically formerly healthy cells that do not want to die, growing and dividing in an uncontrolled manner,
        invading other normal cells as well.</p>
      <p>There are a multitude of variations of the disease, ranging from bone cancer which can cause persistent bone pain,
        to skin cancer that presents as patches or bumps, and even blood cancer which is challenging to detect.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>The treatment for cancer is commonly done through various therapies, including immunotherapy to prompt the body to
        kill cancer cells, and surgery to remove affected areas such as tumors.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Statistics</h2>
      <p>Medical researchers estimate 5% to 12% of all cancers are caused by genetic mutations. A person's risk of cancer
        is greatly increased if they have parents with a history of the disease.</p>
      <p>The WHO concludes that roughly 0.33% of the Philippine population has cancer, and the estimate for those linked
        to an inherited faulty gene is between 5 and 10 out of every 100.</p>

      <h2>Anemia</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Short Description</h2>
      <p>Is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Description and Symptoms</h2>
      <p>People that lack the ability to produce enough red blood cells are considered to be anemic, and some of the common
        symptoms are shortness of breath, paleness of the skin, headaches, and more.</p>
      <p>Inherited anemia usually comes from having a faulty gene from your parents. However, not all variants of anemia
        can be passed on.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>The treatment for anemia usually involves intake of iron supplements and a healthy diet.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Statistics</h2>
      <p>According to the National Institute of Health, anemia affects 40.1% of all infants, 24.6% of pregnant women, 23%
        of elderly males, and 19.1% of elderly females.</p>

    <div class="diseases">
      <h2>High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Short Description</h2>
      <p>Hypertension is when the pressure of the blood vessels is too high with a 140/90 or higher blood pressure.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to disability, a poor quality of life, or even a deadly heart attack
        or stroke.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
      <p>Moderate or severe headaches, anxiety, shortness of breath, nosebleeds, palpitations, or feeling of pulsations
        in the neck.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>Lifestyle changes can help lower blood pressure:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Eating a healthy, low-salt diet</li>
        <li>Losing weight</li>
        <li>Being physically active</li>
        <li>Quitting smoking</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Statistics</h2>
      <p>Hypertension remains disproportionately high among Filipinos compared to others. In the Philippines, a sizable
        proportion of the population has hypertension, ranging from 19.2% among adults ages 20-59 years old to 35% for
        those aged 60 years old and above.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Cause</h2>
      <p>Hypertension usually develops over time. It can happen because of an unhealthy lifestyle, such as not getting
        enough exercise.</p>

      <h2>ADHD</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Short Description</h2>
      <p>A neuridevelopmental condition characterized by attention and impulse control difficulties, often accompanied
        by hyperactivity.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a condition that affects people's behaviour. People with
        ADHD can seem restless, may have trouble concentrating and may act on impulse.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
      <p>Inattentiveness (difficulty concentration and focusing)</p>
      <p>Hyperactivity and impulsiveness</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>ADHD can be treated using medicine or therapy, but a combination of both is often best. Treatment is usually
        arranged by a specialist, such as a pediatrician or psychiatrist, although the condition may be monitored by
        a GP.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Statistics</h2>
      <p>
        Worldwide, ADHD affects 3-5% of people, with 80% of Philippine adolescents and 60% of adults experiencing symptoms.
        Concerningly, 40-50% of children with ADHD have learning disabilities, and 35% do not complete high school.

      <h2>Autism</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Short Description</h2>
      <p>Is a spectrum disorder affecting social interaction, communication, and behavior. It varies in severity and
        often appears in childhood, requiring lifelong support.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Autism can exhibit varying degrees of symptoms and strengths. People with autism may have difficulty
        understanding social cues, expressing themselves verbally or nonverbally, and adapting to changes in
        routines.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
      <p>Possibility of having delayed language, movement, cognitive or learning skills.</p>
      <p>Hyperactive</p>
      <p>Unusual mood or emotional reactions</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>There are a multitude of therapies to help cope with autism but take note that because it is a spectrum
        disorder there is no one solution.</p>
      <p>There are specific therapies to help cope with what a patient may be lacking specifically on a certain aspect
        such as behavioral management therapy in order to reinforce wanted behaviors.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Statistics</h2>
      <p>The senate of the Philippines has disclosed the number of autistic people in the Philippines is virtually
        unknown due to the fact that it has been lacking in government support and that it can be difficult to
        actually diagnose someone with it.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Cause</h2>
      <p>Unfortunately there is actually no known concrete cause of autism, some claim that it is due to the abnormal
        developments in the brain. At the current moment the only thing that is guaranteed is that it is hereditary
        due to the fact that a whole family lineage may actually get diagnosed by it.</p>

    <div class="diseases">
      <h2>Schizophrenia</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Short Description</h2>
      <p>Schizophrenia is an intricate mental disorder impacting thinking, emotions, and behavior, often causing
        hallucinations and delusions. Its origins involve genetics, brain chemistry, and environment.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder with profound impacts on both physical and mental health. It disturbs
        brain functions, affecting thoughts, memory, senses, and behaviors, leading to challenges in daily life.
        Untreated, it disrupts relationships, impairs thought organization, and increases the risk of injury and
        illness.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
      <p>Delusions</p>
      <p>Hallucinations</p>
      <p>Disorganized thinking (speech)</p>
      <p>Extreme disorganized or abnormal motor behavior</p>
      <p>Negative symptoms</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>Though there is no known cure for schizophrenia, there are several treatments that can help the person live
        his or her life independently. Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder and needs management.</p>
      <p>Antipsychotic drugs and ECT</p>
      <p>Caring for someone with schizophrenia</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Statistics</h2>
      <p>According to the latest WHO data published in 2020, Schizophrenia Deaths in the Philippines reached 127 or
        0.02% of total deaths. The age adjusted Death Rate is 0.14 per 100,000 of population, ranking Philippines #40
        in the world.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Cause</h2>
      <p>Experts haven’t found one specific cause of schizophrenia, so they cannot say for sure if genetics cause
        schizophrenia. However, having a family member, particularly a parent or a sibling, with schizophrenia
        significantly increases the risk of developing the condition.</p>
      <p>Imbalances in chemical signals your brain uses for cell-to-cell communication.</p>
      <p>Brain development problems before birth.</p>
      <p>Loss of connection between different areas of your brain.</p>
