        <h2>Rise of cognitive assistive technology</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Assistive technology is a very broad term used to describe the technologies whose primary purpose
            is to aid individuals with disabilities. But to be more specific cognitive assistance primarily
            focuses on any device or software that enables people to better understand and interact with their
            surrounding environment.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        Such as word prediction software which greatly assists people to recall
        specific words to help improve their linguistic skills. Using specific custom fonts in order to
        make readability easier.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        Browsers having a <q>focus mode</q> in order to temporarily disable notifications
        or other distractions and maybe even enlarging certain portions of text just like when you hover your mouse
        over this segment.

        <h2>Gene therapy:</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gene therapy is a revolutionary approach to treating genetic disorders by manipulating an individual's
            genetic material to correct, replace, or supplement faulty genes.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        It involves introducing genetic material
        into a person's cells to either restore the function of a mutated gene or provide a new function that
        compensates for the defective gene. The ultimate goal of gene therapy is to treat or cure diseases at
        their root genetic cause.

        <p>A vast majority of devices were designed for individuals that can use their arms or legs properly.
            If an individual is lacking the ability to use their hands then a new set of special devices must
            be tailored specifically for their use case.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        Companies like logitech have designed very inclusive
        and open-ended controllers just to play video games.

        <h2>Hacking insulin pumps</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Insulin pumps are tiny portable machines that are usually strapped to a belt and small
            tubes attached to the body in order to administer the appropriate doses of chemicals
            that diabetic patients require around the clock. Older models were designed so that you
            have to manually adjust the dosages yourself but this becomes a problem if youâ€™re asleep.
            Unfortunately companies were very slow or even ignorant in solving this problem.
            Causing individuals to hack their own pumps by flashing open source software in order
            to automate all the dosages being administered to them by the machine alone.

        <h2>Prosthesis and Implant advancements</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Advancements in science have finally reached a point where the reconnection of body parts is no longer
            limited to replacing body parts such as limbs and arms. We have finally reached a monumental milestone
            due to the fact that a man who had been paralyzed for 12 years due to a cycling accident has regained
            the ability to walk using a new device that connects his brain and spinal cord.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        The device, known as
        a "digital bridge," allows the man to control his legs with his thoughts. Electrodes on his brain transmit
        signals to electrodes on his spinal cord, stimulating movement.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        This breakthrough was achieved through a
        combination of brain and spinal implants, training sessions, and a computer system worn by the patient.
        The study, published in the journal Nature, demonstrates significant progress in restoring voluntary movement
        to individuals with spinal cord injuries.

        <h2>Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring Device</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            Technology is playing a helpful role in monitoring hypertension. People can more readily monitor their blood
            pressure.
            The Cuffless blood pressure is one promising development. Instead of traditional cuffs that can be
            uncomfortable, cuffless
            monitoring uses modern methods including sensors and algorithms to detect blood pressure without the need
            for a tight
            band around the arm. People may monitor their blood pressure using these tools, which are commonly included
            in smartphones,
            making it easy and painless for people to check their blood pressure. This technology can simplify and
            improve the management of hypertension,
            providing a potentially helpful remedy for people.

        <p></p>
        <p>
            People with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hypertension Disorder) can manage their symptoms as well as improve
            their quality
            of life with the use of modern technology, which offers tools and resources to help them do so.
            Organization, time management,
            and focus are made easier by apps and digital technologies. While instructional software experience is
            supported by text-to-speech
            and speech-to-text technologies. The daily lives of people who have ADHD are improved by wearable
            technology, meditation apps, and medicine
            reminder apps. Additionally, online counseling services offer simple access to mental health treatment.
            Technology gives people with ADHD the
            ability to better control their symptoms and overall health, with lifestyle changes recommended by
            healthcare providers.
